        <p class="lead mb-4">I am always excited to be given the opportunity to help others, whether it be packaging food for the homeless community, or as a COPE Health Scholar at Riverside Community Hospital. As a Health Scholar, I am given the opportunity to assist nurses with their daily tasks, while also being given the opportunity to perform many of them on my own. Throughout my time, I was able to show the hospital staff that I am someone who can be trusted with confidential information, and perform many serious tasks such as answering and transferring phone calls, answering peoples questions, and providing excellent care to families and patients. I have also received numerous awards for my outstanding attitude, determination, and persistence. Although not listed in my resume, I also served as an office assistant during my high school years. Therefore, I possess a plethora of knowledge when it comes to copying, sorting, and delivering documents in a timely manner. 

My punctuality and organization skills are some of the things that I take immense pride in. I make it a goal to never procrastinate on any tasks, and instead prioritize them so I can complete each one in a timely manner. As a result of this, I have never missed, nor turned in an incomplete assignment, during my middle school, high school, and college years. Additionally, I am flexible with my work environment, in that I am accustomed to work in teams, independently, or under supervision. One of my strongest qualities that I possess is my versatility. The versatility that I possess allows me to adapt quickly, and work efficiently on many different tasks. Also, my ability to speak Spanish gives me the opportunity to talk with individuals who have difficulty understanding English. This creates a comfortable and engaging environment because it gives Spanish speakers the opportunity to ask questions and voice any concerns that they may have.<br><br>

       My knowledge about technology and ability to diagnose problems that arise from devices is something that I have been commended on by numerous of people. Whenever someone encountered a problem, I was able to quickly find it and fix it. Technology has always been an area that I have been able to excel in whenever people needed help with their devices. My ease with technology will help me learn how to operate the equipment that is needed for this position both efficiently. <br><br>

        Furthermore, I believe that is also very important to work together collaboratively on assignments. This is because it allows everyone the opportunity to voice their opinions and express their ideas. By doing this, we can be able to offer feedback, try different plans, test new hypothesis, and ultimately learn from each other. I believe that I am someone who excels in this area as I am very social, outgoing, hardworking, and never afraid to ask others when I need help. I also enjoy helping others with any situations that they are in. I believe that by doing this I am giving back to those who have helped me.
